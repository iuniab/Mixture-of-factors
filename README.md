This project was a coursework I undertook as part of my studies at UCL. 
Analysis is performed on Fisher's Iris flower data (1936). We employ both the mixture of factors model and the k-means algorithm and use the former to deal with missing data (in Q3). The code is accompanied by a knitted PDF report.
